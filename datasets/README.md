# Load *your* data

Use this folder  to manage personal datasets. Don't forget to update paths correctly. 

Each network deals with data differently, often requiring special config files or trasformations. 
You can put your data also with a copy-paste in each folder they dedicate to it; however, this 
could generate harmful redundancy. We suggest to put here the origina image-label folders, that
can easily addressed or converted by individual projects.

Don't use this folder to save results.

# Disclaimer
The so called `motive` or `MoTIVE` dataset is not public yet, since it refers to an
[ognoing project](https://motiverc.wordpress.com/). 
Therefore, some data redirections could be missing.
